# BIDS conversion

## Step 1: Conversion of MRI data to the Brain Imaging Data Structure (BIDS) using HeuDiConv

### Overview

After MRI data was acquired at the MRI scanner, we converted all data to adhere to the [Brain Imaging Data Structure (BIDS)](http://bids.neuroimaging.io/) standard.
Please see the [paper by Gorgoleski et al., 2016, *Scientific Data*](https://www.nature.com/articles/sdata201644) for details.
In short, BIDS is a community standard for organizing and describing MRI datasets.

### Code and software

#### `heudiconv` container, version 0.6.0

We used [HeuDiConv](https://github.com/nipy/heudiconv), version 0.6.0, to convert our MRI DICOM data to the BIDS structure.
First, we created a Singularity container with HeuDiConv in our cluster environment at the Max Planck Institute for Human Development, Berlin Germany.
The Singularity container is separately available at [https://github.com/lnnrtwttkhn/tools](https://github.com/lnnrtwttkhn/tools) and was created using:

```bash
singularity pull docker://nipy/heudiconv:0.6.0
```

For the conversion of DICOM data acquired at the MRI scanner to BIDS-converted NIfTI-files the following scripts were used (these scripts can be found in the in the `code/heudiconv/` directory):

#### Mapping raw DICOMS to BIDS: `highspeed-heudiconv-heuristic.py`

`highspeed_heudiconv_heuristic.py` is a Python script, that creates a mapping between the DICOMS and the NIfTI-converted files in the BIDS structure.

```{python, echo=TRUE, code=readLines(file.path(path_root, "code", "heudiconv", "highspeed-heudiconv-heuristic.py")), eval=FALSE, python.reticulate=FALSE}
```

#### Changing participant IDs: `highspeed-heudiconv-anonymizer.py`

`highspeed-heudiconv-anonymizer.py` is an executable Python script, which is used in combination with the `--anon-cmd` flag of the `heudiconv` command that turns the original participant IDs (that we used when we ran the study in the lab) into consecutive zero-padded numbers (see [this thread on neurostars.org](https://neurostars.org/t/heudiconv-how-to-turn-subject-ids-into-consecutive-zero-padded-numbers-as-required-by-bids/2240) for details)

```{python, echo=TRUE, code=readLines(file.path(path_root, "code", "heudiconv", "highspeed-heudiconv-anonymizer.py")), eval=FALSE, python.reticulate=FALSE}
```

As a side note, the last step is not really necessary since zero-padded numbers are not required by the BIDS standard.

#### Running `heudiconv` on the cluster: `highspeed-heudiconv-cluster.sh`

`highspeed-heudiconv-cluster.sh` is a bash script that parallelizes the HeuDiConv command for each participant on the high-performance cluster of the Max Planck Institute for Human Development Berlin, Germany.

```{bash, echo=TRUE, code=readLines(file.path(path_root, "code", "heudiconv", "highspeed-heudiconv-cluster.sh")), eval=FALSE}
```

We acquired both pre-normalized and non-normalized MRI data (see e.g., [here](https://practicalfmri.blogspot.com/2012/04/common-persistent-epi-artifacts-receive.html) for more information on pre-normalization).
All analyses reported in the paper were based on the **pre-normalized data**.
Only the pre-normalized data set is published because uploading the dataset in two versions (with- and without pre-normalization) would otherwise cause interference when running fMRIPrep (see [here](https://neurostars.org/t/addressing-multiple-t1w-images/4959)).

## Step 2: Removal of facial features using [pydeface](https://github.com/poldracklab/pydeface)

### Overview

Facial features need to be removed from structural images before sharing the data online.
See the statement from [openfmri.org](https://openfmri.org/de-identification/) below regarding the importance of defacing:

> *To protect the privacy of the individuals who have been scanned we require that all subjects be de-identified before publishing a dataset. For the purposes of fMRI de-facing is the preferred method de-identification of scan data. Skull stripped data will not be accepted for publication.*

and a second statement from the [openneuro.org FAQs](https://openneuro.org/faq):

> *Yes. We recommend using pydeface. Defacing is strongly prefered over skullstripping, because the process is more robust and yields lower chance of accidentally removing brain tissue.*

### Code and software

#### `pydeface` container, version 2.0.0

Defacing of all structural images was performed using [`pydeface`](https://github.com/poldracklab/pydeface), version 2.0.0.

To ensure robustness of the defacing procedure, we used a Singularity container for `pydeface`, which we installed as follows:

```bash
singularity pull docker://poldracklab/pydeface:37-2e0c2d
```

All scripts that we used for defacing can be found in the `code/defacing` directory.

#### Defacing structural images: `highspeed-defacing-cluster.sh`

First, we ran `highspeed-defacing-cluster.sh` to deface all structural images that can be found in the corresponding BIDS data set.
Note, that this script was optimized to run on the high performance cluster of the Max Planck Institute for Human Development, Berlin.

```{bash, echo=TRUE, code=readLines(file.path(path_root, "code", "defacing", "highspeed-defacing-cluster.sh")), eval=FALSE}
```

#### Replacing defaced with original images: `highspeed-defacing-cleanup.sh`

`pydeface` creates a new file with the ending `T1w_defaced.nii.gz`.
As `fMRIPrep`, `MRIQC` and other tools need to use the defaced instead of the original image, we need to replace the original with the defaced image.
This can be done separately after `pydeface` was run.

In order to replace the original structural images with the defaced once ([as recommended](https://neurostars.org/t/defaced-anatomical-data-fails-bids-validator/3636)), we ran `highspeed-defacing-cleanup.sh`.

```{bash, echo=TRUE, code=readLines(file.path(path_root, "code", "defacing", "highspeed-defacing-cleanup.sh")), eval=FALSE}
```
